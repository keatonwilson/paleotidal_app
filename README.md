# Paleotidal Visualization Shiny Application

A tool built in shiny to explore ocean-based models going back 21k
years.

## Description

Generally, this app is designed to allow users to explore four main
datasets in a spatial/map format that represent the outputs of modeled
data. Users can visualize how different modeled outputs have changed
over time by using slider controls or through an animation, which
trigger updates on the map portion of the app. In addition, users can
zoom to a particular area of the map, click individual cells to get more
granular data, and choose some specifics/thresholds associated with
particular data sets. The app will serve as a visualization
tool for nonmodelers.

## Getting Started

```         
git clone https://github.com/keatonwilson/paleotidal_app.git

### Dependencies

-   Package dependencies (and R) are handled via
    [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html). Run
    `renv::restore()` to get started after cloning.
